This is a portfolio of all the work I have done using Python and Java.

# Description of the Finance Calculators project
- This program was written in Python.

- This is an application which allows the user to access 2 different calculators, an investment or bond calculator, by inputting the 
  appropriate action.
  
- For the investment, the user should input the amount of money they wish to invest, the interest rate, the number of years they wish to
  invest, whether they want to earn compund or simple interest.
- Using all the information which the user has inputted, calculate the earnings the investor will make.

- For the bond calculator, the user should input the price of the home, the interest rate, the number of months they wish to repay the bond
- Using all the information which the user has inputted, calculate the monthly bond repayment

- This could be potentially used by small financial companies to become more efficient.

# Instructions for developing, using and testing

- If the user selects the investment calculator:
 1. The user must input the amount of money the would like to invest, without the currency sign.
 2. The user must input the interest rate without the percentage sign.
 3. The user must enter the number of years they plan to invest for.
 4. The user must select between Simple or Compund interest
 
 - If the user selects the Bond calculator:
1. The user must enter the price of the property without the currency sign
2. The user must enter the interest rate without the percentage sign
3. The user must enter only the number of months they would like to pay of the bond
