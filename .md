# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of all the work I have done using Python and Java

# The Game

- This was written in Python
- This is a simple game where the player's objective was to and get to the money icon, using all 4 of the arrow keys while avoiding enemy objects moving at different
  speeds and coming at different positions on the screen.
- This could be used by anyone trying to get rid of boredom in their lives and have some fun.

# Instructions dor developing, using and testing

- Just run the file in an IDE and play using the 4 arrow keys
