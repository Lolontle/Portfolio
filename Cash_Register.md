# Portfolio
This is a portfolio of all the work I have done using Python Java, MySQL, HTML/CSS and JavaScript

This application is a that accepts the price as its first argument, payment as its second argument and the cash in the drawer as the last argument. It should return the change and how much is
left in the drawer or insuffiecient funds if there is not enough money in the drawer to give the customer change and sort the change out from the highest to the lowest bill.
