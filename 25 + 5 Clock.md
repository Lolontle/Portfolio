# 25 + 5 Clock
Built a 25 + 5, also known as a Pomodoro Clock. It is a clock which helps its user create timed work sessions and allow for timed breaks. It is
fully customizable, as you can set your preferred amount of time you want to work and take a break. It shows a countdown clock as well as a beep to
alert you whne a work session or a break session is complete.

This was written in JavaScript (jQuery), HTML and CSS (Bootstrap)
